What is inside zip file:
1. Folder "Code_Matlab" which contains
	AI_Project.m
	AI_Project_Clustering.m
	all_accuracy.m
	col_extraction.m
	distanceMetricFuncation.m
	false_negative.m
	false_positive.m
	feature_extraction.m
	row_extraction.m
	true_negative.m
	true_negative_rate.m
	true_positive.m
	true_positive_rate.m
2. PDF Report file "Final_AI_Report.pdf"

Instructions to run the project:
1. Import all the files present in "Code_Matlab" folder.
2. Change the path for the dataset written in AI_Project.m and AI_Project_Clustering.m file.
3. Now, in console type "AI_Project(1, 1)", First "1" represent 1st feature extraction and second "1" represent first classifier. (Note: number of feature extraction methods and classifiers are mentioned in report so according to that give the input numbers)
4. Similarly, Run the "AI_Project_Clustering(1, 1)" for clustering part. (Note: don't forget to point to correct location for datasets and number of clustering methods are defined in report)
